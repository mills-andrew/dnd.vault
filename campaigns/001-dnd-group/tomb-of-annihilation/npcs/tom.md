flaw: Expects the best in himself and everyone around him. He can be a hard-ass but really just wants you to be the best version of you.

Close to retirement, just a few years away. He’s been with the family since my father came of age. When I was a wee dwarf Tom was ready to retire but I was always getting into trouble and he really didn’t trust me to not kill myself climbing a mountain. He’s well-kept, bit of a stickler for rules and loathes that I just ran off from Uni and dragged him along. I see him as my respectable old uncle who’s always making sure I sit up straight and I couldn’t live without him. He’s the major-domo and handles basically everything, finances, scheduling, keeping the other Ts in line but most importantly always carrying and applying my Band-Aids. He absolutely hates frogs and would burn a pond down if he could.
