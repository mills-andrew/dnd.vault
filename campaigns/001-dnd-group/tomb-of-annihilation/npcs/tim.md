flaw: Wears his heart on his sleeve and should he not trust you (which just accept that he won’t and move on, it’s so much easier) he will loudly scream while waving a knife around and stare you down with his one eye.

Nowhere near retirement. He’s been with me for some 50 odd years as my dietician. He wears a bright pink eye patch to cover his missing eye. He’s also extremely distrusting of everyone, even himself. But damn does he make a mean roast duck. He drives Tom absolutely insane and is constantly in his face about some guy who looked at him and can he please throw a cabbage at his head. He’s also constantly side-eyeing Tod, which I’m pretty sure will continue even after he’s dead. Do not touch his stuff, do not comment on his pink eye patch but MOST IMPORTANTLY eat your vegetables!
