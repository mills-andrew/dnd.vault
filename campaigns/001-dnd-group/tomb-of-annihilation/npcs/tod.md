He’s the newbie. Only been with me for about 5 years. Since he’s the newbie he gets the grunt work of being messenger. He’s damn good at his job however, despite being very naïve, trusting and frankly dense. He’s a people pleaser and can not handle his ale. He has a little mischievous side to him which I take advantage of by getting him to help me put frogs in Toms boots. Overall he’s one of those few dwarves that see the good in everyone first and will trust you within seconds of meeting you. He’s Toms nephew and a little younger than me in his late 80s. His current mission is to get Tim to fully trust him but he burned toast once so he’s basically dead to Tim.
