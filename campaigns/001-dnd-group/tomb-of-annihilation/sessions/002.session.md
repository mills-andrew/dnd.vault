## Introduction:


## Summary: 

Starting our day at the Thundering Lizard Inn, we ask directions to Wakanga Otembu's house and set out for a morning stroll. On our way there, we come across the Grand Souk marketplace. Britney (Timberleigh Roughbarks) finds a back alley food vendor and buys "discounted, day-old t-rex (on a stick)" and pays 1gp to eat it. We reach Wakanga Otembu's and Teal (what is Teal's character name?!) charms the guards to finally let us in. Sindra gives us some bad news: - all material wealth we'd hoped to use to get started was on the boat - she has probably 30 days to live, and is essentially powerless because she's trying to sustain her lifeforce - either the T-Rex meat was very very illegal, or was some other, more mysterious meat As well as a direction: talk to the harbor master, Xindar, to see if the ship has checked in. She also says that she'll try to get us rooms in the estate for tonight rather than paying for an inn again. The harbor master Xindar, a dragonborn, warns us against taking a job for the Zhentarim, especially "Roka", seems really angry they posted a job flier on his bulletin board. There's been no sign of the ship, they haven't checked in, will be sending patrols out for them soon. He offers a job hunting the pirate captains and their ships, pays well. Britney has her dietician fetch her more mystery meat. Xindar also gave us a job poster for a missing poster, and we'll head back to the Thundering Lizard to investigate it. Xindar tells us that Servants are illegal in Chult, every employee is actually an independent contractor selling their service as their business. He finds out who Britney's parents are and makes a weird handsign, which Teal points out. He slipped one of Britney's retainers a coin with an image, three drops going into a bowl. We get the coin from him against his protestation, "has no idea what that was about".

At Thundering Lizard, we get some mead and talk to the client, Zandela - they can't pay upfront, but offer 600gp if we bring her dad, Artis Simber, back alive. She has a ?pet? pseudodragon that keeps shushing her and preventing her from talking about things. Marc talks to it in draconic (some bar patrons notice). We ask about the symbol on the coin, dragon says to present it to our guild if we need help. Marc says he isn't part of a guild in genuine confusion, which is nearly a dealbreaker, but recovers by making the weird handsign and saying "I'm but a simple researcher", as if was concerned someone could overhear us. **ALSO, IMPORTANT, ARTIS SIMBER WAS LAST SEEN LEAVING THUNDERING LIZARD WITH A REPTILIAN** We choose a guide from the list (Azaka Stormfang) and ask the barman to let them know to meet us at Wakanga's later, then head out. On our walk, we encounter a "crazed prophet" type, who says "Ancient one below the forbidden city gives birth to a terrible new god. The snakemen know. The snakemen know!" before running off. We then hear a commotion, and investigate - the undead are storming the city's gates. We help out, earning their gratitude and some small rewards (a healing potion and "whatever item you want from my shop, come by in the morning"), also meeting our preferred guide in a meetcute. There's some kind of bigbad in the shadows that retreats when it's over, I shoot him in the back and get cursed for my efforts. (edited)
    
In terrible pain, Marc gets helped back to Sindra who manages to remove the curse but has questions about the origins. She says the curse came from the "staff of the forgotten one" an artifact long lost. We introduce our guide to Sindra and plan. Still no sign of Wakanga, but the house is servantless. We are considering looting a little bit in order to fund our expedition. Next time: go to that shop and get stuff for our journey. It's a 20-day round trip, which Sindra does not appreciate.
    
INTRIGUE: I have suspicions that the eldest of Britney's retainers is in fact a spy for a faction her parents are a part of, and Britney is here as his cover. We've ruled out Harper and Zhentarim, and I frankly don't know what the other factions are and refuse to google it.

## Key Npcs:

[[Syndra Silvane]]


## Encounters: 

### Threat at the gates of Malar's Throat

Alarm horns declare that undead are attacking Malar’s Throat. Mercenaries keep the monsters out of the city proper, but people are trapped in the temple of Tymora and besieged by 2d6 [[codex/monsters/zombie]] and 2d6 [[codex/monsters/skeleton]] led by a [[codex/monsters/ghoul]]. If the characters defeat the undead, the temple rewards them with 5 gallons of tej and a [[codex/items/potion-of-healing]].
