## Introduction:
For the past several days, the talk of the streets and taverns has all been about the so-called death curse: a wasting disease afflicting everyone who’s ever been raised from the dead. Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied. When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised — and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they’ve ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.

At first, the passengers are a bit disoriented, as they adjust to the life at sea. The constant motion of the ship beneath their feet takes some getting used to, and some of the crew members are prone to seasickness in the first few days of the journey. But as time goes on, they start to find their sea legs and the routines of life on board become more familiar.

The captain stands at the helm of the ship, his hand on the wheel, as he scans the horizon for any signs of danger. He is a seasoned sailor, with many years of experience on the high seas, and he knows how to keep the ship and its crew safe. He is respected by the crew for his knowledge and leadership, and they trust him implicitly.

The crew is divided into various teams, each with their own duties and responsibilities. Some are responsible for manning the rig and keeping the sails in good condition, while others are responsible for the maintenance of the ship itself, ensuring that it is seaworthy and in good repair. There are also those who are responsible for cooking and serving meals, as well as those who are responsible for keeping the ship clean and sanitary.

As the crew goes about their duties, they also take turns keeping watch for any signs of danger. They know that there are pirates and other dangers on the open seas, and they must be constantly vigilant to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew. They scan the horizon for other ships, keeping an eye out for any that might be hostile.

Despite the potential dangers, there is also a sense of camaraderie and community on board the ship. The crew is working together towards a common goal, and they rely on each other for support and encouragement. As they spend more time at sea, they get to know each other better and forge strong bonds of friendship.

The players find themselves aboard a ship sailing towards the mysterious land of chult. The ship is a large, three-masted sailing vessel called the [The Crimson Star]'. As they look around, they see a crowded deck full of sailors, merchants, and adventurers. The ship is heavily laden with cargo, including crates of supplies barrels of fresh water, and coop of chickens and other livestock.

The players can also see the captian and crew of the ship, who are busy directing the sailors and making sure they ship stays on course. The captain, a gruff and weathered man named Captain Edmund Blackwood, he greets the players and gives them a quick rundown of what to expect on their journey.
