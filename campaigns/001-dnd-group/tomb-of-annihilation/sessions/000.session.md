#### Introduction:
The port was bustling with activity as the crew of the ship made their final preparations for their jouney to the distant land of Chult. The air was thick with the smell of salt water and the sound of seagulls circling overhead. The ship was a sturdy merchant vessel, with sleek lines and a weather-beaten exterior that spoke to its long years of service on the high seas.

As the crew loaded crates of supplies onto the ship, the captain addressed them, his voice carrying over the din of the port. 

[[Captain Edmund Blackwood]]: "Welcome aboard the merchant ship 'The Crimson Star'. We are about to set sail on a journey that will take us to the fabled land of Chult, a place of mystery and danger, filled with treacherous jungles, deadly predators, and ancient ruins. But for the adventurers of the world, Chult holds a different kind of allure. It is said that within the jungles lies an ancient tomb, filled with untold riches and powerful magic."

Everyone around you listening to the captin nods there heads, low grunts of "Yah", and "Hmm", with slightly curled smiles.

[[Captain Edmund Blackwood]]: "As you may know, for years, many have come from all over to seek their fortunes in the tomb, but none have returned. Recently, however, the death toll has risen dramatically, with entire expeditions disappearing without a trace."

He then pauses to see the worry on a few faces. Trying to gain a sense of fear.

[[Captain Edmund Blackwood]]: "The leaders of the world are now starting to believe that something sinister has awoken in the tomb, and that the true treasure within its walls is not gold and magic, but something far more sinister."

[[Captain Edmund Blackwood]]: "This ship, will take us to Chult. We will be at sea for many days. Even reaching the shores will prove to be a challenge. However, as the only Galleon merchant ship of these seas, we have safe passage. We bring food, supplies and safety to those in need, even those you may find, less than civil. You may not agree with our methods but its how we survive these waters. As long as we work together, we will have no issue getting to our destination. I have faith in each and everyone of you."

The crew nodded their heads, their spirts and confidence buoyed by the captain's words. They had heard tales of Chult and its wild jungles, its ancient ruins and lost treasures. They knew that this journey would be one of the greatest challenges they had ever faced, but they were eager to take it on.

Around the busseling ship there are a veritiey of different characters. Brooty men and women walking around organizing their goods. Orcs, dwarfs, elves the like, all look as though they have seen their fair share of combat. 

As the last of the supplies were loaded, the captain gave the order to set sail. The ship slowly pulled away from the dock, and the crew unfurled the sails, catching the wind and propelling the ship forward. The crew worked in perfect unison, with each of them performing their assigned tasks with skill and precision.

As the ship sails out of the port and into the open sea, the crew is filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation. They know that they are leaving behind the familiar comforts of land and entering a world of uncertainty and potential danger.
