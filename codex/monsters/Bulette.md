    desc: "If the bulette jumps at least 15 ft. as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its ft. in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target&#x27;s choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn&#x27;t knocked prone, and is pushed 5 ft. out of the bulette&#x27;s space into an unoccupied space of the creature&#x27;s choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette&#x27;s space."
