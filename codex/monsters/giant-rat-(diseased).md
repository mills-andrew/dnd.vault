If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can&#x27;t regain hit points except by magical means, and the target&#x27;s hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target&#x27;s hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies."
