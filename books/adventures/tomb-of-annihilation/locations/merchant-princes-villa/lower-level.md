### Lower Level

Paintings, statues, murals, frescoes, tapestries, and oil lamps meant to impress guests decorate this level.

#### 1. Entryway

This pleasant, breezy, tiled courtyard includes a splashing fountain and green plants. Visitors can refresh themselves in a washroom to the left of the entrance before meeting residents of the villa. The entry portico is always guarded by 1d4 + 1 [[codex/monsters/gladiator|Gladiator]] recruited from the merchant prince’s extended family or hand-picked for their loyalty and fighting prowess. These guards are always on alert against tricksters and magicians trying to gain entrance to their master’s home, so they have advantage on skill checks and saving throws against attempts to distract, bamboozle, or charm them.

The ceiling of the entryway is two stories tall. In some homes, it’s open to the sky. In those cases, the fountain is sunk into the floor and doubles as a drain for rainwater.

#### 2. Sitting Area

This is both a waiting area and a meeting area for guests who aren’t known to the villa’s master, and therefore won’t necessarily be given access to the inner chambers of the house. Decorative columns support the arched doorway from area 1. Rugs and comfortable pillows are arranged on the floor. Narrow windows look into the garden, but these double as arrow slits in case visitors aren’t as friendly as they claim to be.

#### 3. Grand Hall

A magnificently tiled floor is flanked by two sweeping staircases that ascend to the upper floor. Decorations are in keeping with the individual merchant prince’s taste and specialization.

#### 4. Guest Rooms

Most of the right side of the house is devoted to accommodations for guests. Three private sleeping rooms with attached baths, plus two sitting rooms and access to the garden, make this far more luxurious than a typical inn.

#### 5. Garden

Ferns, potted palms, orchids, and other tropical flowers are cultivated in the garden, which is open to the sky. Chultan plants with useful properties or applications as poison might be found in the garden of a merchant prince with a horticultural bent, such as Jessamine. See [appendix C](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/discoveries#FloraandFauna) for examples of rare plants.

#### 6. Dining Room

The dining table is very low, just a few inches above the floor. Diners relax on pillows as they eat.

#### 7. Sauna

In addition to daily baths, well-to-do Chultans love relaxing in saunas. Dry heat is a welcome change from Chult’s high humidity. Most home saunas are heated with charcoal burners or hot stones, but in the homes of the merchant princes, a trapped [[codex/monsters/fire-elemental|Fire Elemental]] provides round-the-clock heat, and a servant is always available to massage tired muscles.

#### 8. Bath

The bath is the cornerstone of a Chultan mansion, even more so than the dining room or family rooms. The family relaxes here during private times, but there’s nothing unusual about a merchant prince holding meetings in the bath with trusted advisors and close business associates. Being invited into the household bath is considered an honor in Chultan society, and treating it as anything less than an honor risks offending the person who extended the invitation.

#### 9. Kitchen

The kitchen is large, high-ceilinged, and well ventilated; otherwise, heat from cooking fires would make it unbearably hot. Stairs lead up to the laundry room ([area 14](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#14Lighthouse)).
