### Upper Level

The rooms on this level are decorated for comfort. The artwork and other decor reflects the taste of the merchant prince to whom the villa belongs.

#### 10. Library

Chultans are fans of mythical romance, and the city has an active literary community with many book clubs. Port Nyanzaru’s most successful novelists and playwrights concoct stirring tales about legendary heroes who pursue their lovers through unimaginable danger and save them from fates worse than death — which is more likely to involve a forced marriage to someone who doesn’t love them than being eaten by an impossibly huge tyrannosaurus, although monstrous tyrannosauruses make regular appearances in these tales, too.

A character who spends a few hours sifting through the formulaic fiction and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([[investigation]]) check finds useful books of Chultan lore mixed in with the romances. Use this as an opportunity to answer specific questions posed by the players. A library won’t reveal the location of Omu, but a book of lore might mention the city and describe it as it was during its height.

#### 11. Family Rooms

The merchant prince’s children, spouses, and other close family members live in these apartments. They are richly appointed with pillows and tiger-skin rugs.

#### 12. Master Suite

The merchant prince’s suite is the most opulent room in the palace. A pleasant breeze blows through large, lattice-covered windows, causing the potted plants to sway gently. The headboard of the master bed is fantastically carved in motifs suggestive of the merchant’s business. Connected rooms contain a small, private bath and a walk-in closet filled with expensive clothing, mirrors, combs, and so forth.

_**Treasure.**_ The suite contains personal items equivalent to two rolls on the “Gems or Art Objects” column of the [Treasure Hoard, Challenge 0–4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#TreasureHoardChallenge04) table in the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg). If the room contains jewelry, there is a 50 percent chance it is in a locked jewelry box requiring thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open.

#### 13. Guard Rooms

This guard room is intentionally set in the midst of the family rooms and the master suite. The guards are responsible for safeguarding the family during their most vulnerable time, when they’re sleeping or relaxing in their own chambers. This station is always manned by 1d4 + 1 [[codex/monsters/gladiator|Gladiator]] who are fanatically loyal to the merchant prince and richly rewarded for their devotion.

#### 14. Laundry Room

Chultans are as scrupulous about their clothing as about their bodies — a fastidiousness that’s almost essential, given how much everyone sweats in Port Nyanzaru’s climate. Laundry is washed here every day, then hours are spent fanning it to and fro on lines trying to encourage the wet cloth to dry in the humid air.

#### 15. Servants’ Quarters

The servants’ quarters are isolated from the family sleeping areas for security. There is nothing remarkable about them.

#### 16. Rain Traps

Every room in the house contains (at minimum) a small water basin with running water coming either from a rooftop basin or lifted from barrels or an underground cistern by a water wheel.
