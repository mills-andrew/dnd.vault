### Harbor Ward

Port Nyanzaru’s harbor can accommodate ships of all sizes. The enclosed, eastern portion of the harbor is reserved for the use of the merchant princes, but the rest of the docks are available for use by any ship.

If the characters wish to travel by sea, they can book passage on the _Brazen Pegasus_ at a cost of 10 gp per day (for the whole party). A 60-foot sloop built for speed, she has a single mast flying a square mainsail plus two triangular foresails, one aft sail, and a small topsail. All that canvas gives her a top speed of 10 mph under ideal conditions.

The _Brazen Pegasus_ is captained by Ortimay Swift and Dark (CG female rock gnome [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16799-bandit-captain) with [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet), who is both clever and calm. The first mate is Grig Ruddell (N male Illuskan human [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran)), a hulking man whose face is almost hidden by a heavy beard streaked with gray. Other than shouting orders at the crew and conversing in low tones with Captain Ortimay, Ruddell barely speaks. The remainder of the crew consists of six sailors (N male and female [bandits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16798-bandit) of various ethnicities).

Characters might assume that Ortimay’s chief business is smuggling — and they’d be correct. However, she is happy to take adventurers wherever they need to go. She knows about the dragon turtle in the Bay of Chult and expects the characters to provide the necessary tribute. She also knows that pirates prowl the waters around Chult, though her ship easily outruns theirs.

There are no permanent shelters or cabins on the main deck of the _Brazen Pegasus_. A tarp can be rigged across the aft portion of the deck for shade from the tropical sun. The sailors sleep on deck when weather permits. The lower deck houses Captain Ortimay’s cabin and the cargo hold, which doubles as the crew’s cooking, eating, and sleeping area in foul weather.

#### 11. Royal Docks

The term “royal” dates back to the age when Chult was ruled by true kings and queens instead of merchants. Now these docks are reserved for the exclusive use of the merchant princes and those diplomats, dignitaries, and influential foreign merchants whom the merchant princes want to flatter with privilege or impress with magnificence.

#### 12. Statue

The statue at the center of the harbor represents an ancient Chultan king in full regalia, resplendent in a loincloth of leopard skin and a headdress of feathers, shells, and tyrannosaurus teeth; draped in a cape of girallon fur and monkey tails; and wielding the traditional oval shield and yklwa of Chult. Residents call it Na N’buso, the Great King.

The statue isn’t nearly as ancient as the mythic king it portrays. It was erected just five years ago, at a time when Port Nyanzaru was flexing its new mercantile muscle, to impress on foreigners that Chult is an independent land with a glorious history. Few who see it fail to get the message.

#### 13. Harbormaster’s Office

Outside of the harbormaster’s office is a bulletin board that provides the names and whereabouts of several wilderness guides (see “[Finding a Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#FindingaGuide)”). The harbormaster is a half-gold dragon named [Zindar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/33281-zindar) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/monsters-and-npcs#Zindar)). He’s seldom in this sturdy, airy building, however; most of his time is spent dealing with the hundreds of disputes, traffic jams, and other minor problems that crop up every day on a busy quayside. Zindar finds that his imposing personal presence gets issues resolved more quickly and more to his satisfaction than any number of subordinates can accomplish. Clerks in the office seldom know exactly where Zindar is at any time, but messages can be left for him; he’ll leave a reply within 1d6 hours.

If characters present themselves as adventurers, Zindar offers them a quest (see “[Side Quests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#SideQuests)”).

#### 14. Lighthouse

A flame burns atop the lighthouse day and night to guide ships through darkness, fog, and rain to the harbor. Various powders can be added to the fire to create thick columns of colored smoke that can be seen from Fort Beluarian and from the mines along the Bay of Chult.

#### 15. Fort Nyanzaru

The fort contains a winch for raising and lowering an immense iron chain stretched between the fort and the lighthouse. When the chain is raised, no ship can sail into or out of the harbor. The chain hasn’t been raised against attackers in decades, but it’s used occasionally to prevent a ship from slipping out of the harbor with criminals or contraband on board. The fort also mounts two ballistae that can launch heavy bolts or canisters of alchemist’s fire. Its garrison consists of a [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble) (the castellan), four [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran) (officers), and forty [guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard) loyal to the merchant princes.

#### 16. Warehouse District

Goods of every type being shipped into or out of Port Nyanzaru are stored in these warehouses. Canals are cut between the rows of warehouses, allowing ships to be towed by harnessed dinosaurs directly to the desired warehouse for easier loading and unloading. A large ship can easily block a canal, so good traffic management is required; that’s one of the harbormaster’s responsibilities.

Like any warehouse district, this one is largely deserted at night, making it a good spot for secret meetings and other mischief.

#### 17. Dry Dock

Port Nyanzaru isn’t famous for building ships, but many vessels that come here wind up needing hull repairs — especially those that had run-ins with typhoons, pirates, or Aremag the dragon turtle (see “[Bay of Chult](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/the-land-of-chult#BayofChult)”). It’s easy work for dinosaurs to drag ships out of the water into the drydock so holes can be patched and barnacles scraped off.
