### Tiryki Anchorage

This district east of the city is populated by animal trainers, river folk, explorers who need inexpensive lodging, and other rough-and-tumble sorts. Smugglers prefer the unregulated docks of the anchorage over the policed and inspected docks of the harbor, despite the shortage of dock workers and beast-powered cranes to assist in loading and unloading.

Unlike Malar’s Throat and the Old City, Tiryki Anchorage has no fortified temple or ancient stone ziggurats where residents can take shelter against undead or carnivores. Most people dash for Tiryki Gate when the alarm sounds and hope to get through before it’s locked ahead of them. Fortunately, the animals in their pens are more sensitive to approaching enemies than humans are, so few creatures are able to sneak into the area undetected.

#### 25. Dinosaur Pens

Most of the beasts of burden in the city were trained out here, and they’re penned up at night. Ankylosauruses and triceratopses are the most common in that role. Dinosaurs trained for street racing are also stabled here. Most Chultan handlers have a +5 bonus to [Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling) skill checks, and they work with the same animals day after day.
