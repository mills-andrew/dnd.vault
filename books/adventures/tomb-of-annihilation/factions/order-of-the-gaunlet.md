### Order of the Gauntlet

Members of the Order of the Gauntlet vow to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. Placing their faith in good-aligned deities such as Torm, Helm, and Tyr, they bring the strength of their faith, their hearts, and their weapons to bear against villainy.

The order has committed considerable resources toward quelling the undead menace in Chult. Its forward base, Camp Righteous, was overrun by undead. The order, undaunted, built a new fortification even deeper in the jungle. Dubbed Camp Vengeance, it has fallen on hard times. Its commander is a woefully inept noble named Niles Breakbone. His lieutenants are more likely to share useful information or offer aid, but only if the characters offer some form of assistance to Camp Vengeance in return.

All members of the Order of the Gauntlet are unflinchingly brave, but many of their expeditions fare poorly or meet with outright disaster when confronted by conditions that confound their training and contradict their mindset.
