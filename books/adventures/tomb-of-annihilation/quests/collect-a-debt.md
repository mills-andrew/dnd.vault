## Summary

K’lahu (N female Chultan human [thug](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17035-thug)), a bookie who takes bets at [Execurtioner's Run](_index #Executioner’s Run), asks the adventurers to come with her as she collects a debt. The pay is 10 percent of whatever is collected on the 500 gp debt, which is owed by a man named Taban (N male Chultan human [gladiator](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16903-gladiator)). Taban refuses to pay anything until he’s beaten down to 20 or fewer hit points, whereupon he offers up a pouch containing ten 50 gp gemstones. Ashamed by his defeat and eager to redeem himself, Taban offers to join the party as a follower, demanding no pay for the duration of the adventure.
