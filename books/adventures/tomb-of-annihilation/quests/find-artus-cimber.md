## Summary

A half-elf named [Xandala](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/33273-xandala) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/monsters-and-npcs#Xandala)) approaches the characters and claims to be Artus Cimber’s daughter. Feigning worry, she asks the characters to help her find him. Artus can’t be found using magic, but Xandala has heard that Artus left the city with a reptilian man who doesn’t talk and smells funny. Both were last seen heading into the jungle. Xandala wants the [Ring of Winter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/21727-ring-of-winter) in Artus’s possession, but she doesn’t share this with the characters. Summerwise, Xandala’s pet [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16986-pseudodragon), thinks the quest for the ring is too dangerous but has given up trying to talk sense into its mistress. Good-aligned characters might be able to turn Summerwise against Xandala, or at least get information from it that they can use to thwart Xandala’s plan or to aid Artus.

Artus Cimber, a former member of the Harpers, is hiding out in Chult. He possesses an artifact called the [Ring of Winter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/21727-ring-of-winter), and other Harpers are concerned lest the ring fall into evil hands. To prevent that, a handful of Harper spies are combing Port Nyanzaru and Chult for clues to Artus’s whereabouts — ostensibly to protect the ring, but exactly what they’ll do when they find it is an open question. Magical efforts to locate Artus are futile, as the [Ring of Winter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/21727-ring-of-winter) shields itself and its wearer against divination spells and scrying sensors.
