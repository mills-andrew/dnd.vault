## Summary

Undril Silvertusk (LG female half-orc [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16985-priest) of Torm with [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet) is a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet and newly arrived in Port Nyanzaru. She needs to deliver herself plus a packet of dispatches from her superiors to Commander Niles Breakbone at Camp Vengeance. Undril was led to believe she could simply buy a horse in the city and ride to the camp, but now that she sees the terrain and conditions, that’s clearly not possible. She hopes to join any expedition headed up the River Soshenstar. Undril is quite attached to her chain shirt, but she’s not unreasonable when presented with good arguments for shedding the armor. If characters gain Undril’s respect, she’ll intercede strongly on their behalf if any difficulties arise with Commander Breakbone (as they’re likely to, as discussed in [chapter 2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/the-land-of-chult#CampVengeance)).
