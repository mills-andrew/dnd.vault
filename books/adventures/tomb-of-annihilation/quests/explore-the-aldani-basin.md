## Summary

Inete (LG female Chultan human [acolyte](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16763-acolyte) of Savras) has had disturbing visions of red-robed wizards operating a secret base somewhere in the Aldani Basin. The head of her temple, Grandfather Zitembe, has too many other things on his mind, but he’s given Inete permission to investigate. Inete would like to accompany the characters’ expedition for safety, if characters are heading toward or through that region. She’ll provide her own food and supplies, and “donate” another 100 gp to the expedition’s expenses. She insists on stopping by the temple of Savras to gather her belongings and urges the characters to come along. If they do, the characters can meet Grandfather Zitembe (see [area 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#7TempleofSavras)).
