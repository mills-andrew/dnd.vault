### Summary

Rokah (N male Chultan human [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17021-spy)) works for the Zhentarim. The Zhents believe that pirates have formed an alliance with the Flaming Fist. Rokah has orders to infiltrate Fort Beluarian and find proof so that the Zhentarim can blackmail the fort’s commander. He asks the adventurers to escort him safely to the fort and create a distraction so that he can ransack the commander’s quarters. As a reward, Rokah offers to cover the cost of a charter of exploration (50 gp), which the characters will almost certainly need if they want to avoid future confrontations with the Flaming Fist. Rokah also offers to introduce the characters to two wilderness guides — a pair tabaxi siblings named River Mist and Flask of Wine (see “[Finding a Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#FindingaGuide)”) — and pay the guides’ fees.
