## Summary

Belym (LG male Chultan human [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)) is distraught because his husband, Draza (LG male Chultan [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)), has been sentenced to Executioner’s Run for stealing. Belym asserts that his husband was a victim of mistaken identity and sentenced without a proper hearing or trial. He’s been unable to persuade anyone in authority that Draza is innocent. He’ll give the characters 25 sp (all his savings) if they can help Draza from the sidelines so he survives the run. Draza is about to be thrown into the pit with a pair of [velociraptors](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17243-velociraptor), so the characters must act quickly. Both the authorities and the gamblers take a dim view of interference.
