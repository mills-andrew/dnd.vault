## Summary

Omala (N male Chultan human [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)) is a master colorist at the dye works ([area 23](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#23DyeWorks)). He recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye. Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society — a grim warning. He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayothé, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit. Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone (see [area 4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#4Goldenthrone)), where he plans to beg for Kwayothé’s forgiveness. He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayothé is willing to forgive Omala’s lapse in judgment provided the characters agree to kill a man named Shago within the next 10 days — no questions asked — and speak of the deed to no one. Kwayothé tells them that Shago works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayothé has Omala sentenced to Executioner’s Run (see [area 2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#2ExecutionersRun)) for his crime.
