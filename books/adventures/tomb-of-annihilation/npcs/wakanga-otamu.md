_Deals in magic and lore_

Wakanga O’tamu (LN male Chultan human [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16947-mage)) is the only arcane spellcaster among the merchant princes. He’s a long-time friend of Syndra Silvane, and he’s something of a dandy who’s easily seduced by smart women — or perhaps that’s only a carefully constructed public image. Unknown to his peers, Wakanga is sympathetic to the Harpers and allows them to use his villa as a safe house.

Wakanga deals in knowledge, information, lost lore, potions, and scrolls. He knows of the death curse but little else about it. If the characters seem committed to ending the curse, he’ll help them as best he can, including selling them minor magic items (see the Magic Items for Sale table). Wakanga has a monopoly on these items in Port Nyanzaru, so characters either pay his prices or go without. As much as he wants to help, he’s unlikely to extend credit; all purchases must be in coin, gemstones, or jewelry.

_**Wizard’s Journal.**_ In his collection, Wakanga has a tattered, water-damaged explorer’s journal that was brought out of the jungle 15 years ago. It describes a wizard’s explorations of various places in Chult, but not in enough detail to locate them on a map. The unnamed author does, however, make many mentions of his only traveling companion: a shield guardian named Vorn. If the characters befriend Wakanga, he gives them the journal and shows them on Syndra’s map where it was found (he accurately indicates the hex containing the guardian; see “[Vorn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/the-land-of-chult#Vorn)” in chapter 2 for more information). The journal contains a picture of Vorn’s control amulet but provides no clues to the amulet’s current whereabouts. As reward for finding and retrieving the construct and its control amulet, Wakanga offers a spellbook containing fifteen randomly determined spells (roll a d6 to determine the level of each spell).
