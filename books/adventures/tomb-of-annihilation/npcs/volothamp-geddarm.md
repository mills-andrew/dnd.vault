Characters can encounter Volo anywhere in Port Nyanzaru. For more information on him, see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/monsters-and-npcs#VolothampVoloGeddarm).

The legendary world traveler is in Port Nyanzaru to deliver signed copies of his new book, _Volo’s Guide to Monsters_, to the merchant princes (some of whom he knows well, and others he claims to know well), and to promote his latest work. Characters are most likely to encounter Volo in one of the city’s inns or taverns, or in a merchant prince’s villa.

Volo is a font of information, but not everything he says is true, despite his hearty avowals of accuracy. He won’t venture outside Port Nyanzaru under any circumstances.

If the characters buy a copy of Volo’s book (50 gp for a durable hardcover edition), they can put it to use. Any time they want to know lore about a particular monster described in the book, give them useful tidbits from [Volo’s Guide to Monsters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vgtm). Do not impart game statistics, since such information would not be available in-world. If this reference is unavailable, use the information in [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/monsters-and-npcs).
