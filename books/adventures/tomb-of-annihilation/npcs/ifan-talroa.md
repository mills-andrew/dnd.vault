_Deals in beasts and beast training_

Ifan Talro’a (NE male Chultan human [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble)) is a greedy, conniving man supported by influential and dangerous friends among the Zhentarim. He is jealous of Wakanga O’tamu’s magical power and Ekene-Afa’s reputation from the arena. Talro’a sells animals that can be trained as mounts or pets, including dinosaurs and flying monkeys. The yuan-ti of Omu secretly pay Talro’a to warn them if treasure hunters are headed south into the deep jungle. He uses flying snakes as messengers. Talro’a doesn’t know for certain that the messages go to yuan-ti, but he strongly suspects it.

Ifan has no family and no close relationships. He is naturally distrustful of everyone.

_**Buying Beasts.**_ Ifan Talro’a employs dozens of merchants throughout Port Nyanzaru who not only serve as his spies but also sell domesticated beasts that can be used as companions, mounts, or pack animals. Flying snakes trained as messengers are popular with the Zhentarim, and Talro’a sells them to no one else.
