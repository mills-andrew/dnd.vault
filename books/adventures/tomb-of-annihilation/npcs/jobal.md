_Deals in guides and sellswords_

Jobal (NE male Chultan human [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout)) made a fortune as a wilderness guide when the party he was working for discovered a stunning cache of Chultan gold and jewels. Miraculously, only Jobal survived the gauntlet of undead and dinosaur attacks, making it back to Port Nyanzaru in a canoe laden with treasure. There’s no doubt he’s led a life of adventure; his body bears many scars from his escapades. His chief spy, confidante, and consort is Aazon Talieri (NG male Tethyrian human [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17021-spy)). Jobal trusts him implicitly, and Aazon’s loyalty is beyond reproach.

Because of his dealings with explorers, Jobal has an intense interest in maps of Chult. He would pay the characters handsomely for Syndra Silvane’s map, if he learns of its existence. If they refuse to sell, he’ll resort to theft, and eventually to murder.

_**Hiring a Guide.**_ If the characters visit Jobal in search of a guide, he recommends that they seek out one or more of his guides in Port Nyanzaru (see “[Finding a Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#FindingaGuide)”). Jobal assigns Aazon the task of escorting the adventurers to whichever guides interest them. Jobal doesn’t require payment up front, since all guides in Port Nyanzaru are required by law to pay him a fair cut of their earnings.

If the characters follow Jobal’s advice and accompany Aazon, give them copies of handouts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 (see [appendix E](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/player-handouts)) as Aazon introduces the party to various guides in the city.
