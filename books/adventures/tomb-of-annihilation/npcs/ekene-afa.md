_Deals in weapons, shields, traveling gear, rain catchers, saddles, wagons, and canoes_

Ekene-Afa (LG female Chultan human [gladiator](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16903-gladiator)) won numerous gladiatorial contests in Port Nyanzaru’s arena before she invested her winnings into financing her first trade deals. She is a legend among the common rabble who grew up watching her battles. Her husband, Kura, is a painter, and they have twin teenage sons named Soshen and Tiryk. Soshen is a city guard, and Tiryk is a popular dinosaur racer. Both were named after Chultan rivers.

Ekene-Afa sells nonmagical weapons and shields of every kind, but most of her inventory consists of flint daggers, yklwas with wooden shafts and obsidian tips (see “[Buying a Special Item](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#BuyingaSpecialItem)”), and shields made of wooden frames with layers of reptile hide stretched over them. Ekene-Afa pays Wakanga O’tamu to place permanent enchantments on a select few of these items, which she sells at the prices listed in the Magic Shields and Weapons for Sale table.
