_Deals in plants, poison, and assassination_

Jessamine (N female Chultan human [assassin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16790-assassin), her hit point maximum reduced to 58) doesn’t speak often. When the council finds itself divided on an issue, however, Jessamine usually casts the deciding vote. Most of her body is hidden under billowy robes and tightly wrapped black bandages.

Jessamine trades in plants, herbs, poison, and sanctioned assassination. Murder is illegal in Port Nyanzaru, as it is almost everywhere, but Jessamine has a monopoly on “sanctions” — writs that allow a killing by ordained methods (usually poison or stabbing with a blade). For an added fee, her agents will carry out the assassination, with results guaranteed. Poison is her specialty, and she has a vast personal collection. She sells all the poisons listed in the Poisons table in [chapter 8](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Poisons) of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg) at market prices.

Twelve years ago, Jessamine had a brief but torrid love affair with an Amnian sea captain. The “fruit” of that affair is a shy daughter named Ymezra. Under Jessamine’s watchful eye, tutors are teaching Ymezra the skills she needs to take over the family business one day.

_**Jessamine’s Curse.**_ Before she went into business for herself, Jessamine worked as an assassin for a Calishite pasha. She died on a mission, but her benefactor paid a handsome price to raise her from the dead. As a result of her misfortune years ago, Jessamine is now suffering from the effects of the Soulmonger’s death curse. She covers her rotting flesh with scarves and bandage wrappings, and she is predisposed to help any adventurers actively trying to end the death curse.
