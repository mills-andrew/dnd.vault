_Deals in gems, jewelry, cloth, and armor_

Zhanthi (NG female Chultan human [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble)) has royal blood in her veins, and few have the courage to dispute the wise, old trader. She’s a secret member of the Ytepka Society (see “[Factions and Their Representatives](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/port-nyanzaru#FactionsandTheirRepresentatives)”), and she has forged ties with the Zhentarim so that she can monitor the organization’s activities.

Zhanthi trades in gems, jewelry, colorful Chultan cloth, and nonmagical leather, studded leather, and hide armor. Her son, Shago, is a guide stationed at Fort Beluarian. Shago sends regular reports to his mother about what’s happening at the fort, but he’s not her most reliable spy among the Flaming Fist.

Zhanthi is one of very few people who’ve stumbled onto evidence of Liara Portyr’s secret arrangement with the pirates, but she keeps this knowledge to herself for the time being. Zindar, the half-dragon harbormaster, is looking for adventurers to dispose of the pirates, while Zhanthi is putting up the reward money.
